If you are an entrepreneur crafting a Minimum Viable Product, it becomes clear this is the right tool for the job, as you want to launch a first version of your idea as soon as possible.

Now, you should also consider that in order to keep this momentum over time, you'll need to design things in a maintainable way (i.e. it resists new requirements without falling apart).
